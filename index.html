                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup
                        language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link
                        between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which
                        defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the
                        computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup
                        languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has
                        to be done on the text.

                    <p>
                        HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the
                        content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the
                        opening tag until the end of the page.

                        The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block
                        elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web
                        pages are created.

                        HTML is used to build websites.
                        It is supported by all browsers.
                        It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc.

                        HTML can only create static web pages. For dynamic web pages, other languages have to be used.
                        A large amount of code has to be written to create a simple web page.
                        The security feature is not good.

                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are
                        fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this
                        is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web
                        pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each
                        web page.

                        Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of
                        the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without
                        CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So
                        for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.

                    <p>
                        Tags for formatting a web page were never intended in HTML. HTML was established to define a web
                        pages content. The addition of tags like and color attributes to HTML created a big problem for
                        web developers. The creation of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to
                        each page, became a time-consuming and costly procedure. CSS was established to address this
                        issue. CSS eliminated the HTML pages style formatting.

                        How CSS is different from HTML?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        HTML is used to define a structure of a web page whereas CSS is used to style the web pages by
                        using different styling features.
                        HTML consists of tags inside which text is enclosed and CSS consists of selectors and
                        declaration blocks.
                        CSS can be internal or external depending upon the requirement.
                        We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet but we can use CSS inside an HTML document.
                        CSS has comparatively higher backup and support than HTML.

                    <p>

                        Node.js is an open source server environment
                        Node.js is free
                        Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
                        Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Node.js can generate dynamic page content
                        Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
                        Node.js can collect form data
                        Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

                    <p>
                        A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the
                        client.

                        Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

                        Sends the task to the computer's file system.
                        Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
                        Returns the content to the client.
                        Ready to handle the next request.
                    </p>

                        Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
                        A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
                        Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
                        Node.js files have extension ".js"

                    <h2>document-database</h2>
                    <p>
                        A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs.
                        MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include other documents,
                        arrays, and arrays of documents.
                    </p>

                        Key Features
                    </h1>
                    <h2>High Performance
                </div>h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,

                    Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.

                    Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.
                </p>
                <h2>Query API</h2>
                <p>
                    The MongoDB Query API supports read and write operations (CRUD) as well as:

                    Data Aggregation

                    Text Search and Geospatial Queries.
                </p>
                <h2>High Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB's replication facility, called replica set, provides:

                    automatic failover

                    data redundancy.
                    A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy
                    and increasing data availability.
                </p>
                <h2>Horizontal Scalability</h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality:

                    Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.

                    Starting in 3.4, MongoDB supports creating zones of data based on the shard key. In a balanced
                    cluster, MongoDB directs reads and writes covered by a zone only to those shards inside the zone.
                    See the Zones manual page for more information.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    This tutorial walks you through inserting test data into a MongoDB database and querying that data
                    using the documentation's embedded web shell. You do not need to deploy or install MongoDB to
                    complete this tutorial.

                    The examples in this tutorial use a subset of the Sample Mflix Dataset, which is part of the sample
                    data included in MongoDB's cloud-hosted service, MongoDB Atlas. Atlas requires no installation
                    overhead and offers a free tier to get started. After completing this tutorial, you can use Atlas to
                    explore additional sample data or host your own data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    MongoDB Atlas provides an easy way to host and manage your data in the cloud. This tutorial guides
                    you through creating an Atlas cluster, connecting to it, and loading sample data.

                    You can get started with Atlas through the Atlas CLI or the Atlas User Interface. Select a tab based
                    on how you would like to get started:
